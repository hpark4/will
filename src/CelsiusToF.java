 * Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
 * It should (1) prompt the user for input, (2) read a double value from the keyboard,
 * (3) calculate the result, and (4) format the output to one decimal place using printf.
 * For example, it should display "24.0 C = 75.2 F".

 * Here is the formula. Be careful not to use integer division! F = 9/5 C + 32
 *
 * Sample runs:
 * Enter a temperature in Celsius: 24
 * 24.0 C = 75.2 F
 *
 * Enter a temperature in Celsius: 100.078
 * 100.1 C = 212.1 F
 *
 * Enter a temperature in Celsius: 12.345
 * 12.3 C = 54.2 F
